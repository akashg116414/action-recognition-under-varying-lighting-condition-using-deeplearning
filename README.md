# Action Recognition Under Varying Lighting Condition Using Deeplearning
1. please use Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and mxnet with CPU mode.
2. the experiments conducted use Gluon CV model Z00
3. please also install OpenCV and Skimage to successfully run the experiments
4. This is also contains a custom video dataset containg approx 600 videos in varying lighting condition 
5. The research suite is used to understand the performance and speed of Action Recognition models under varying lighting condition
6. the experiment contains three pretrained models I3d, C3d and SlowFast which use Kinetics400 weights
